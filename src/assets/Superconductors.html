<h4 id='background'>Background</h4>
<p>The superconductivity phenomenon was discovered in 1911 by Dutch physicist <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes'>Heike Kamerlingh Onnes</a>, it is achieved by cooling materials down to very low temperatures, usually with liquid helium (4.2K).</p>
<h4 id='introduction'>Introduction</h4>
<p>Let&#39;s say we have an battery-light setup, the battery creates a potential difference, which will induce a flow of electrons.</p>
<p>[animation of such]</p>
<p>The wire is a metal conductor, its metallic lattice contains free electrons that are loosely bound and move easily when there is a potential difference.</p>
<p>[animation of such]</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we had an insulator, its electrons are strongly bound to the nucleus, hence electrons can not flow through them easily. This will not stop super high potential differences from stripping the electrons off, such as in a lightning.</p>
<p>[animation of lightning]</p>
<p>Even in good conductors, the atoms inside still vibrate around and collides with the flowing electrons, this cause the electrons to lose energy, resulting in resistance.</p>
<p>When the material is hotter, atoms vibrate more and usually has a greater resistance. And when the material is cooler, the resistance is cooler.</p>
<p>However for some materials, when it is cooled under a certain temperature called the critical temperature, it has the effect of superconductivity. Its resistance drops to zero and currents can flow through it without losing energy.</p>
<p>[graph of resistance temperature]</p>
<p>That means if you have a looping coil of superconducting wires, and run a current through it, it will not lose energy. Some had done this and left it running for years without measurable lose in intensity of the current.</p>
<h4 id='explanation'>Explanation</h4>
<p>If we look at the metallic lattice of our superconducting material, it has been cooled by liquid helium and hence the vibrations are negligible. </p>
<p>Free electrons flow in the direction of the potential difference between atoms of the lattice. These atoms are positively charged since they lost their electrons.</p>
<p>[animation of such]</p>
<p>These atoms will be attracted to the electrons and move slightly towards the electron. That makes the region slightly more positively charged. This will attract electrons behind it</p>
