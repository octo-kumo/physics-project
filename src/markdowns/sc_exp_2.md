## Quantum Physics

However, simple electrostatic interactions is not enough to explain the weird phenomenon. Just like many other things, if we dig deep enough, we end up in the quantum realm.

We first have to look at the two classes of elemental particles, **Bosons** and **Fermions**.

In the quantum world, each particle has an inherit spin, or its **quantum number**. The SI unit of spin is the same as classical angular momentum ($N\cdot m\cdot s$ or $kg\cdot m^2\cdot s^{-1}$). This value divided by the reduced plank constant $\hbar$ to give the quantum spin number $s$.

For all elemental particles, its spin number can be represented as $s=\frac n2$, where $n$ can be any non-negative integer.
Note that there can be half spins, which are **fermions**, and those with integer spins are called **bosons**.

The two families of particles obey different rules and *broadly* have different roles in the world around us.

### Fermions

**Fermions** follow the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle), where two particles can not share the same state, that is, there cannot be two identical fermions simultaneously having the same quantum numbers (meaning, roughly, having the same position, velocity and spin direction).

Electrons, protons, neutrons are all **fermions**.

Hence in a atom, there are electron shells. If there were no such principle, all the electrons can collapse into the lowest energy shell, and no reactions would occur.

#### Fermi energy

Even if fermions are cooled to absolute zero, they still have **fermi energy**. It refers to the energy difference between the highest and lowest occupied single-particle states.
