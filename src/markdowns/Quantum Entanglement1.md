Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles is generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. In other words, these groups of particles are connected in such a way that knowing one state of one particle, you can determine the other particles states.

For example, two electrons are in a entangled quantum state such that when one is measured to be spin-up, the other one will always be observed to be spin-down and vice versa and their total spin is zero. According to quantum mechanics, it is impossible to predict which set of measurements will be observed. Thus, by measuring one system, it will instantaneously influence the observations of other systems that are entangled with it. Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, polarization performed on entangled particles in some cases be found to be perfectly correlated.
