### Type II Superconductors

Some superconductors lose their superconductivity immediately above their critical temperature, some superconductors however has a *buffer zone* where they show a mix of normal and superconductive behavior. In this buffer zone, they are called **Type II superconductors**.

Unlike type I superconductors which can't be penetrated by magnetic fields, type II superconductors can. They do not exhibit a full Meissner effect and hence magnetic fields can partially penetrate the superconductor. !!Type I superconductors, if thin enough, thinner than the **London Penetration Depth**, will also allow magnetic fields to penetrate it!!

This allows for **flux pinning**, which type I superconductors can not do.
