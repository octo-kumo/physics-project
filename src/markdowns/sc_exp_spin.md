### Electrons

- Although electrons have a spin of $s=\frac12$, we assign it a number $m_s$ to uniquely identify the quantum state in a degenerate subspace of the Hilbert space of spin $s$
- $m_s$ can be either $\frac 12$ or $-\frac12$, representing a up spin, or a down spin
- According to the Pauli exclusion principle, in a atom, each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their **spin quantum number**
- Due to collisions of atoms and electrons, electrons in a current move at a low speed.
  - However, the speed at which a change of current at one point in the material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. 
  - This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.
