Thus, it would only take a few repetions to confirm that we have found the element in the database. Grover's algorithm can be used in database applications to quickly search for an element in the database. It can also be used to speed up the time required to solve sudoku puzzles.

# The Future of Quantum Computing
While quantum computers may sound like a promising technology that will bring about significant changes to areas such as cybersecurity, quantum research and AI, it is still a relatively nascent field that is yet to develop into what we would expect. One of the current best quantum computer, Sycamore by Google, can only handle 53 qubits, which is far less that what is required for quantum computers to tackle exponential problems.

Breaking the RSA encryption, which is used to protect our daily Internet activities such as bank transactions and private messages, has been proven to be achievable using Shorâ€™s algorithm (at least in theory). However, it would require at least 10,000 qubits $-$ far from what we have now. 

Developments of quantum computing technology have largely been undermined by the challenges of error correction and reducing noise. As mentioned, qubits are very sensitive and is very susceptible to external changes. The environment in which quantum computers operate in is also requires high precisions: we are trying to measure the spin of a single electron! This has resulted in a signficiant hurdle that has slowed down efforts to scale up the number of qubits. Sceptics of quantum computing technologies also claimed that it may not be physically possible to build scalable quantum computers.

All in all, It will probably be a while before quantum computers can be used in a practical context. Only time will tell if quantum computers will be able to achieve its promised applications.
