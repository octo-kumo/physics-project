Quantum superposition  brings about a paradox which is now known as the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment . It was devised by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. In this experiment a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects when a single atom decays in the box, the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat. So after a certain amount of time will the cat be dead or alive.  You would not know if the cat was dead or alive until you opened the box. By  treating this scenario as a quantum superposition, it is said that the cat can be considered simultaneously both alive and dead as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This seems very mysterious as the cat should only be either dead or alive not both. We can say that the cat is in an entangled superposition of quantum states.
