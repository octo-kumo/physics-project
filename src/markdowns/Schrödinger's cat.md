# **Schrödinger's cat**

Schrödinger's cat  though experiment that illustrates a paradox of quantum superposition that was devised by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. The experiment is that a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects when a single atom decays in the box, the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat.  You would not know if the cat was dead or alive until you opened the box. By quantum superposition, it is said cat can be considered simultaneously both alive and dead as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This seems very mysterious as the cat should only be either dead or alive not both.
