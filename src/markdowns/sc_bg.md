The superconductivity phenomenon was discovered in 1911 by Dutch physicist [Heike Kamerlingh Onnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes) it can only be explained with quantum physics.

Superconductivity is achieved by cooling materials down to very low temperatures, usually with liquid Helium (below 4.2K or -268.95°C).

It is characterized by the [Meissner effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissner_effect), where all magnetic field lines are not allowed to pass through the object, they instead curve around the object. This differentiates superconductors from the idealized zero resistance, or perfect conductivity of classical physics.

In 1986, some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials was discovered to have a critical temperature above 90 K (−183 °C). Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor, leading the materials to be termed high-temperature superconductors.
