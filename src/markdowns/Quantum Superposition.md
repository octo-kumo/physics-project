# **Quantum Superposition**

Quantum Superposition is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics where it states that any two or more quantum states can be superposed and the result will be another valid quantum state. Alternatively, it states that every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more other distinct states.
In physical terms, lets take an electron. When we measure the spin of the electron it can either spin up (clockwise) or spin down (anticlockwise). According to quantum mechanics the electrons have a supposition when not measured, the electron is a superposition of spin up and down. This means that it has a complex combination of both. 
In mathematical terms state of this physical system can be represented by this:
$$
\begin{align*}
|\psi\rangle = C_1\mid\uparrow\rangle+C_2\mid\downarrow\rangle
\end{align*}
$$
The quantity $|\psi\rangle$ is call the quantum state of the system. The coefficients represent the probability of the electron being spin up or down. As you know from before, this system has a quantum state where it has a certain probability of being spin up or down. The probability for a specified configuration is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient. The probabilities should add up to 1. We know for sure that the electron has to be one of these states when measured..

$$
\begin{align*}
p_{up}&= \mid c_1\mid ^2 \newline
p_{down}&= \mid c_2\mid ^2\newline
p_{up or down} &= p_{down}+p_{up}=1

\end{align*}
$$
$p_{up}$ refers to the probability of the electron being spin up when measured and $p_{down}$ refers to the probability of the electron being spin up when measured. In this example we have consider 2 configurations, but there can be infinitely many. In general, by principal of superposition, the state of quantum state for infinitely many configurations is:	
$$
|\psi\rangle = \sum_{x}\rho(x)|x\rangle
$$
where $\rho(x)$ is the probability density function. $|x\rangle$ can represents the position of the particle.
