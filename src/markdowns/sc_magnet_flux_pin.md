### Flux Pinning

When magnetic fields partially penetrate a type II superconductor, they do it in specific regions. These regions of penetration are called **flux tubes**. The number of flux tubes per unit area is proportional to the magnetic field with a constant of proportionality equal to the **magnetic flux quantum**. On a simple $76mm$ diameter, $1\mu m$ thick disk, next to a magnetic field of $28kA/m$, there are approximately $10^{11}$ flux tubes that hold 70,000 times the superconductor's weight.

At lower temperatures the flux tubes are pinned in place and cannot move. This pinning is what holds the superconductor in place thereby allowing it to levitate. Demonstrations of the effect usually show the superconductor levitating at a fixed distance above the magnet, and is prepared beforehand by cooling the superconductor while it is at that specific distance, fixing the flux tubes at the right position.
