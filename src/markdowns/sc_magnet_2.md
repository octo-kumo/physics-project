### Applications in Magnets

Due to its properties of having no resistance, larger currents can flow through superconductors without heating up or losing energy. This enables the creation of **Superconducting Magnets**, they take advantage of superconductors to create enormous magnetic fields, much larger and easier than traditional wires, stronger than all but the strongest non-superconducting electromagnets. Since no energy is lost to resistance, superconducting magnets can actually be cheaper to operate.

Superconducting magnets are usually used in MRI machines in hospitals, mass spectrometers, fusion reactors and particle accelerators. Usually scientific instruments that require very strong yet stable magnetic fields.

For quantum computers, qubits are subject to quantum errors, and whenever something like a photon interacts with the a quantum state, it can be destroyed. This can seen as nature observing the quantum state, and destroying it.

Obviously this also happens in traditional computers, where high energy particles are able to flip bits. And we usually stack up more electrons, ensuring abundance, to prevent this from happening.

However in quantum computers, bigger systems are more subject to quantum errors. We cannot simply scale the system up to prevent errors. Hence many has adopted to use **superconducting qubits**.

- In traditional conductors, electrons can collide with atoms, sending off waves of quantum information, creating a lot of quantum error.
- In superconducting materials, as explained before, cooper pairs can share the same quantum state and hence would reduce quantum error to almost zero.
