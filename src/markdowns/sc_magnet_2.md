### Applications in Magnets

Due to its properties of having no resistance, larger currents can flow through superconductors without heating up or losing energy. This enables the creation of **Superconducting Magnets**, they take advantage of superconductors to create enormous magnetic fields, much larger and easier than traditional wires, stronger than all but the strongest non-superconducting electromagnets. Since no energy is lost to resistance, superconducting magnets can actually be cheaper to operate.

Superconducting magnets are usually used in MRI machines in hospitals, mass spectrometers, fusion reactors and particle accelerators. Usually scientific instruments that require very strong yet stable magnetic fields.

Superconductors are used in quantum computers to remove the element of resistance when transmitting accurate quantum state data.
