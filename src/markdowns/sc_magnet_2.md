### Superconducting Magnets

Due to its properties of having no resistance, larger currents can flow through superconductors without heating up or losing energy. This enables the creation of **Superconducting Magnets**, which are created with coils of superconducting wires, and running a current through the loop.

They take advantage of superconductors to create enormous magnetic fields, much larger and easier than traditional wires, stronger than all but the strongest non-superconducting electromagnets. Since no energy is lost to resistance, no heating due to resistance, superconducting magnets can actually be cheaper to operate than traditional electromagnets.

Superconducting magnets are usually used in MRI machines in hospitals, mass spectrometers, fusion reactors and particle accelerators. Usually scientific instruments that require very strong yet sensitive magnetic fields. 

They are also used for levitation, guidance and propulsion, such as in Japan's maglev train.

While being used, the superconducting coil needs to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures, hence research on **Room Temperature Superconductors** is very popular.
