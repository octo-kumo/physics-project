#### Cooper pair

However, it is discovered that that an arbitrarily small attraction between electrons in a metal can cause a paired state of electrons to have a lower energy than the Fermi energy, which implies that the pair is bound.

[As said before](#attractionAnchor), attraction distorts the ion lattice, moving the ions slightly toward the electron, increasing the positive charge density of the lattice in the vicinity. This positive charge can attract other electrons. At long distances, this attraction between electrons due to the displaced ions can overcome the electrons' repulsion due to their negative charge, and cause them to pair up.

The rigorous quantum mechanical explanation shows that the effect is due to [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron)â€“[phonon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon) interactions, with the phonon being the collective motion of the positively-charged lattice.

The energy of the pairing interaction is quite weak, of the order of $10^{-3}\text{eV}$, and thermal energy can easily break the pairs. So only at low temperatures, in metal and other substrates, are a significant number of the electrons bound in Cooper pairs.

Electrons have spin$\frac12$, so they are fermions, but the total spin of a **Cooper pair** is integer (0 or 1) so it is a composite **boson**. Therefore, unlike electrons, multiple Cooper pairs are allowed to be in the **same quantum state**.

Hence cooper pairs can, and have the tendency of collapsing into the same **ground state**.
