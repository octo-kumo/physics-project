#### Cooper pair

However, it is discovered that that an arbitrarily small attraction between electrons in a metal can cause a paired state of electrons to have a lower energy than the Fermi energy, which implies that the pair is bound.

The energy of the pairing interaction is quite weak, of the order of $10^{-3}\text{eV}$, and thermal energy can easily break the pairs. So only at low temperatures, in metal and other substrates, are a significant number of the electrons bound in Cooper pairs.

Electrons have spin$\frac12$, so they are fermions, but the total spin of a **Cooper pair** is integer (0 or 1) so it is a composite **boson**. Therefore, unlike electrons, multiple Cooper pairs are allowed to be in the same quantum state. 

This means that all of the cooper pairs can collapse into the lowest possible energy state, which is lower than the fermi energy.
