# Foreword

Before we delve into the topic of quantum computingðŸ’», we feel that it is important that we bring up the objectives of the article, so that you as the reader will be able to better appreciate what will be covered. The article is written for **physics** and **computer science** high school students. Our main goal for the article is:

1. To give the readers a basic understanding of the essence of quantum computers in the most simplistic and intuitive way possible (Don't worry there's no complex math ðŸ˜€)
2. To provide interested readers with a *really* brief overview on quantum computing so that they can decide if they want to delve deeper into the subject
