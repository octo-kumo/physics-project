## Explanation
In this metallic lattice of the superconducting material, it has been cooled by liquid helium and hence the vibrations are negligible. 

These atoms are positively charged since they lost their electrons, they will be attracted to electrons.

Free electrons flow in the direction of the potential difference between atoms of the lattice. 

Atoms will be attracted to the electrons and move slightly towards the electron. 

That makes the region slightly more positively charged. Electrons behind this region will now be attracted to this positively charged region.
