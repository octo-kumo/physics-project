# **Quantum State**

Now we have understood the principle of superposition, but we also need to understand what is a quantum state for us to fully understand quantum superposition. So quantum state is a mathematical entity that provides a probability distribution for the outcomes of each possible measurement on a system. Lets take a coin, in classical mechanics the state of it can be a head or a tail. Though, in quantum mechanics, the quantum state of the coin can be both head and tail or  it is more probable to get head or tail.
