# **Quantum Entanglement**

Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. In another words these group of particles are connected to each other in such a way that knowing one state of one particle, you can determine the other particles states.

For example, two electrons are in a quantum state such that when one is measured to be spin-up, the other one will always be observed to be spin-down and vice versa and their total spin is zero. According to quantum mechanics,it is impossible to predict which set of measurements will be observed. Thus,by  measuring one system, it will instantaneously influence the observations of tother systems that are entangled with it. Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, polarization performed on entangled particles in some cases be found to be perfectly correlated.

Up until now, nobody really knows quite how or why entanglement works. It is also gives the idea that tiny particles that are linked to each other even if they're separated by long distance. It is mysterious as  it can possibly influence other particles faster than the speed of light. This even baffled Einstein, who famously described it as “spooky action at a distance.” 

But it’s key to the power of quantum computers. In a conventional computer, doubling the number of bits doubles its processing power. But thanks to entanglement, adding extra qubits to a quantum machine produces an exponential increase. Quantum entanglement has been demonstrated experimentally with photons,neutrinos, electrons,molecules and even small diamonds. However quantum entanglement is broken when the entangled particles decohere through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made.

For example, to display quantum entanglement the simplest system is of two qubits. This two level system of two entangled qubits can be represented by :
$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)
$$
In this state, called an *equal superposition*, there are equal probabilities of measuring either product state $|00\rangle $ or $|11\rangle$ as  $|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$.In other words, there is no way to tell if the first qubit has value “0” or “1” and likewise for the second qubit. To physically understand how quantum entanglement works here lets say we have two person, P1 and P2 and that these qubits are separated.  When P1 makes a measurement of one of the qubit P2 must get the  same result as the qubits are entangled. So lets say, P1 measures $|0\rangle$ then P2 must measure$|00\rangle$.If P1 measures $|1\rangle$ then P2 must measure $|00\rangle$.
