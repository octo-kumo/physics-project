### Response to Magnetic Fields

When in a magnetic field, superconductors do not allow any magnetic flux to penetrate itself, which is known as
the [Meissner effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissner_effect). As shown, no magnetic field lines are inside the superconductor once it is cooled under its critical temperature, or its superconducting transition temperature.

This cause the superconductor to levitate in the magnetic field.

#### Meissner effect

Any perfect conductor will prevent any change to magnetic flux passing through its surface due to ordinary electromagnetic induction at zero resistance. However, the Meissner effect is distinct from this: when an ordinary conductor is cooled so that it makes the transition to a superconducting state in the presence of a constant applied magnetic field, the magnetic flux is expelled during the transition.
