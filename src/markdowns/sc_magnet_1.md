### Response to Magnetic Fields

When in a magnetic field, superconductors do not allow any magnetic flux to penetrate itself, which is known as
the [Meissner effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissner_effect). As shown, no magnetic field lines are inside the superconductor once it is cooled under its critical temperature, or its superconducting transition temperature.

This cause the superconductor to levitate in the magnetic field.
