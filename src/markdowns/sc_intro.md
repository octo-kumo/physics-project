## Introduction

Let's say we have an battery-light setup, where the 2 ends of a battery is connected to 2 ends of a bulb with wires.

The wire is made up of metal and the metallic lattice is made up of metal atoms with their valence electrons so free they can be looked at as a separate **sea of electrons**. Electrons flow through the lattice easily, like a fluid.

When there is a potential difference, like when we attach a battery, the electrons will move to a lower potential, as all things tends to lower energy states, this creates a flow of electrons or a current.
