## Introduction

Let's say we have an battery-light setup, where the 2 ends of a battery is connected to 2 ends of a bulb with wires.

The wire is a metal conductor, its metallic lattice contains free electrons that are loosely bound and can move easily in the potential difference created by the battery.

They move inside the lattice in the direction of the potential difference, creating a current.
