## Superconductivity

Since the ground state has lower energy than fermion energy, cooper pairs opens a gap in the *continuous spectrum of energy* an electron can have.

To push electrons out of the cooper pair, they have to excite the electron with enough energy to cross the energy gap, this gap forbids small excitement such as electron scattering from happening. 

Not only that, since electrons also follow the Pauli Exclusion Principle, you cannot just break up one Cooper Pair without changing energies of all other pairs, this further increases the difficulty of breaking electrons out of the ground state.

However cooper pairs can be easily broken by thermal vibrations, hence this is only be possible under ultra cool temperatures.

One can look at superconductivity as the electrons being already in the lowest possible energy state, hence no energy will be lost due to resistance, since you can't take more energy from a system that already has minimal energy.
