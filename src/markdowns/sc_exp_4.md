## Superconductivity

Since the ground state has lower energy than fermion energy, cooper pairs opens a gap in the *continuous spectrum of energy* an electron can have. This gap forbids small excitement such as electron scattering from happening. And that is what makes superconductivity possible.

One can look at superconductivity as the electron pairs being already in the lowest possible energy state, and hence no energy can be lost via resistance.
