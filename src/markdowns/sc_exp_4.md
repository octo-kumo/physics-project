## Superconductivity

Since the ground state has lower energy than fermion energy, cooper pairs opens a gap in the *continuous spectrum of energy* an electron can have.

Electrons that are in cooper pairs can travel along the metal lattice in the same ground state (lowest energy state). 

To push electrons out of the cooper pair, they have to excite the electron with enough energy to cross the energy gap, this gap forbids small excitement such as electron scattering from happening. Since electrons follow the Pauli Exclusion Principle, you cannot just break up one Cooper Pair without changing energies of all other pairs.

However as cooper pairs can be easily broken by thermal vibrations, this can only be possible with ultra cool temperatures.

One can look at superconductivity as the electron pairs being already in the lowest possible energy state, hence no energy will be lost due to resistance, since you can't take more energy from a system that already has minimal energy.
