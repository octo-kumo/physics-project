### Superconductors in Quantum Computing

For quantum computers, qubits are usually electrons that store quantum information. Whenever something like a photon interacts with the a electron, its quantum state can be destroyed. This can seen as nature observing the quantum state, and destroying it.

In normal conductors, electrons will very often collide with atoms, sending off waves of quantum information. This creates a lot of quantum error, where quantum information of the electrons are *leaked*. If we add abundance with more electrons to reduce random errors, we increase such collisions, and increase quantum errors.

With superconducting materials, as explained before, electrons can form cooper pairs, and cooper pairs can share the same quantum state, preventing leaking via collision !!because of the energy gap!!. This will reduce quantum error to almost zero, and ensuring that our quantum computer is less prone to quantum errors, and allowing us to use greater currents to reduce random error.

Error prevention is a key part of getting quantum computers to work reliably, hence many, such as Google has adopted to use **superconducting qubits**.
