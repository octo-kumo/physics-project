In traditional conductors, electrons can collide with atoms, sending off waves of quantum information. This creates a lot of quantum error. However we also need the abundance to reduce normal error, hence we must take the best of both worlds.

With superconducting materials, as explained before, electrons can pair up into cooper pairs, and cooper pairs can share the same quantum state. This will reduce quantum error to almost zero, and ensuring that our quantum computer is less prone to errors.
